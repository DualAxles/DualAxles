We’ve all heard of the dangers of a motorcycle. Maybe you’ve heard your mom nag about how noisy and reckless people who ride them are.

Any vehicle where your body is exposed is going to have some risks that come along with it.

So, you might be wondering…

<b>Is a motor scooter safe? And is it safer than a motorcycle?</b>

It depends on the rider and how they’re riding — most of the time. 

Someone who rides recklessly on a motorcycle will probably do the same on a motor scooter. If you ride cautiously and respect the potential dangers on the road — chances are you’ll be safe.

Unlike a car, motor scooters don’t have airbags or seatbelts to keep you safe in case of a collision.

However, you never know what could happen on the road with other drivers.

<b>ALWAYS</b> use precaution and proper safety gear, the chances of you becoming injured will be exponentially less.

<h2>Scooter vs. Motorcycle Safety</h2>

You might have come here wondering — what’s the difference between a motor scooter vs. a motorcycle?

Although motorcycles might seem like they’re more intimidating, motorcycles and motorscooters share all of the same risks.

Here are some things to be aware of with motor scooters:

<h3>Size</h3>

 Usually, motorscooters are going to be smaller and weigh less than your typical motorcycle. 

The average cruise motorcycle will weigh around 500 pounds, while a higher-end 300cc motor scooter like a Vespa will weigh in about 300 pounds.

<b>Why does this matter?</b>

<ul>
 <li>A lighter bike will have a higher center of gravity with you on top of it (most of the time). This means you won’t be able to turn as sharply.</li>
 <li>The physical size is smaller. This can make other cars have a harder time seeing you in traffic</li>
</ul>

<h3>Smaller Wheels</h3>

Depending on the motorscooter you choose, the wheels are going to have a diameter of around 10 to 13 inches.

On the other hand, a motorcycle’s wheel diameter can range anywhere from 16 to over 20 inches.

<b>Why does this matter?</b>

<ul>
 <li>The smaller the wheels on your bike, the more you have to be concerned with bumps, debris, and potholes on the road.</li>
 <li>Smaller wheels may help you make more maneuverable turns in traffic, but it also causes your bike to be less stable at high speeds.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Looks are Deceiving</h3>

Yeah, just because your scooter looks friendly, doesn’t mean you don’t need protection.

Many people, unfortunately, shrug off safety while riding a scooter. Don’t be one of these people.

<h2>How to Be Safe on a Motor Scooter</h2>

Now that you realize the risks of enjoying a cruise on a motor scooter, it’s time to discuss how you can be safe while riding.

<h3>Keep these tips in mind:</h3>

<ul>
 <li><b>Wear a full-sized helmet.</b> Wearing a helmet reduces the chance of head injury by 69%. A full-sized helmet may make you feel less free, but at least your face and chin will have protection. Investing in a good helmet is an insurance policy that you only need to pay for once.</li>

 <li><b>Wear protective clothing.</b> Leather clothes, boots, gloves, and covering your skin will help protect your body and skin from sever skidding injuries.</li>

 <li><b>Ride defensively.</b> No matter where you’re riding, always keep your guard up. Always assume the drivers around you don’t know what they’re doing — just to be safe. Beware of blind spots, use your signals, watch out for vehicles turning, and always ride with your headlights on.</li>

 <li><b>Be visible.</b> Wearing clothes with bright colors is never a bad idea. And riders at night should have some type of reflective tape on their clothes. If other drivers can’t see you, you’re in danger. </li>

 <li><b>Check on your motor scooter.</b> Inspecting your motor scooter before you ride out is another part of safe riding. Perform a quick check-up on your bike’s tires, fluids, lights, and brakes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Laws Regarding Motor Scooters</h2>

In most cases, motor scooter laws are going to be the same if not similar to motorcycles.

Usually, a motor scooter under 50cc is regarded as a moped or scooter, and a motor scooter over 50cc is legally a motorcycle.

Keep in mind that every state will have different laws, so do your own due diligence and learn about your local laws before you get on the road.

<b>Here are some differences in the laws for 50cc motor scooters:</b>

<ul>
 <li><b>You might have to drive on the shoulder.</b> 50cc scooters are going to be significantly slower than the rest of the traffic on the road. Driving on the shoulder allows other vehicles to pass safely.</li>

 <li><b>You might not be allowed to go over 30mph.</b> Since 50cc bikes have more relaxed regulations, you may have to drive under a certain speed. Going over the state speed limit for scooters could result in a ticket for driving without a motorcycle license.</li>

 <li><b>You might not need a driver's license or motorcycle license.</b> In states like Maryland, you just need a driver’s license or a moped permit to drive on the road legally. Some states you don’t need anything, and some states you’ll need a motorcycle license.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Motor scooters are no safer than a motorcycle and should be treated as such.

Before you hop on your scooter and twist the throttle on the open road, prepare yourself and scooter adequately.

It’s always better to be safe than sorry.
