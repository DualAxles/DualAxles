You've just came back from your summer trip to Rome and you're just now realizing how cool and awesome motor scooters are? You've just noticed people zipping around the city on their beautifully aesthetic Vespas and you can't stop fantasizing being one of those people. Alright you're here for a reason, you want to know more about motor scooters. You also want to know what it will take for you be an owner of one of these bad boys. If you're reading this, that probably means that you are someone who is smart enough to do research before investing your time and money into this new compelling interest of yours.

The first thing you're going to need before you even get the pleasure of twisting the throttle, is the proper licensing for your state to take this bike out on the open road. If you're just looking for a bike that is going to take you around town without going on any highways, a 50cc scooter will do. If a 50cc scooter is all you need, a moped permit or driver's license is all you need. Make sure to check your state and local laws first.
