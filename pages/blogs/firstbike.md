You've just come back from your summer trip to Rome and you're just now realizing how cool and awesome motor scooters are?
 You've just noticed people zipping around the city on their beautifully aesthetic Vespas and you can't stop fantasizing being one of those people. Alright, you're here for a reason, you want to know more about motor scooters. You also want to know what it will take for you to be an owner of one of these bad boys. If you're reading this, that probably means that you are smart enough to do research before investing your time and money into this new compelling interest of yours.

The first thing you're going to need before you even get the pleasure of twisting the throttle is the proper licensing for your state to take this bike out on the open road. If you're just looking for a bike that is going to take you around town without going on any highways, a 50cc scooter will do. If a 50cc scooter is all you need, a moped permit or driver's license is all you need. Make sure to check your state and local laws first. Anything higher than a 50cc motor scooter, some kind of motorcycle license will most likely be necessary.

The last thing you would ever want while you're enjoying the open road on your sick ride is for a minor accident to turn into a significant injury. Proper and minimal safety gear such as a full-face helmet and eye protection will save you a trip to the emergency room and your day from being ruined. Feeling the wind in your hair is nice and all, but being safe is always more important and definitely a lot cooler!

Now that you're ready to buy your first motor scooter, you might wonder if you want to save money by going for a used option or spending the extra money to get a shiny brand new one. Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist are always viable places you can use to browse your local scooters. Just be thorough in your research and use your best caution, especially with scooters that are older models that may have been discontinued. If you're willing to spend the extra money and go for a brand new scooter, you can find some good deals online on scooters or it's always beneficial to visit your local scooter dealer. When buying your scooter online, try looking for ones with a lot of reviews, so you can hear feedback from riders before investing your money. Buying a scooter online that you can't find very much alternative information about on other websites is a sketchy way to spend a thousand dollars. If you buy your scooter at a dealer you have the privilege of a first impression before your investment. The professionals at the dealer will also be able to ask any questions you might have and be able to share tips with you to get the most out of your buck.

The last major thing that you are going to want to keep in mind is maintenance. One of the benefits of scooters is that they're relatively low-maintenance however, remember to check the oil and tire pressure monthly. Looking up the recommended maintenance in your scooter's manual is a necessity, but you'll find that the yearly maintenance will be simple and low-stress.

Purchasing a motor scooter is going to be an investment that you most definitely won't regret. It's going to make you look forward to cruising around or getting you to point A to point B with enjoyment. So go ahead and get out there and start living your life on two wheels!
