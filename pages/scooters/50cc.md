<h2 id="TaoTao Thunder 50">TaoTao Thunder 50</h2>
<img src="/img/scooters/50cc/taotaothunder200.jpg" id="page-img">

The Thunder is another amazing budget scoooter on the market with a price you can't beat.

The biggest advantage to this scooter is its larger 12 inch wheels that make this a smooth ride and not lose as much speed going up hills. You won't feel the little bumps on the road as you would with 10 inch wheels. The wheels are also pretty wide, which makes for more stability.

Two lights are on the front of the scooter. One is for low beams and the other is for high beams.

This scooter has a very sharp design, that makes this one of the more handsome scooters on the road.

<h2>The Advantages of a 50cc scooter</h2>

These scooters may not be the fastest thing on the road, but they will undoubtedly get you where you need to go. Whether it's around town or the next town over, you'll make the trip.

One of the biggest advantages they have over other vehicles is its ease on your wallet. Many options are under the $1000 mark, not to mention the affordable maitenance; high gas mileage, affordable parts and relative low maitenance in general.

50cc scooters are all around great investments that can bring you plenty of satisfaction and meet your commuting needs.

<h2>The Best 50cc Scooter For You</h2>

All of these scooters have the same 50cc GY6 engine. However there are differences on the scooters that some people may prefer more than others.

<h3>Smoothest Ride:<a href="#TaoTao Thunder 50"> TaoTao Thunder 50</a></h3>

The Thunder sports larger wide wheels that make this scooter easy to maneuver and handle. This would make this scooter better in areas where the roads aren't so smooth unlike the Thunder.

<h3>Best Value:<a href="#TaoTao ATM-50A1"> TaoTao ATM-50A1</a></h3>

The ATM-50A1 has everything you need for a good street scooter. The best part is obviously the value, which makes it an insane deal. For under $1000 you can be cruising the streets, going wherever you wish at a crisp 30mph.

<h3>Highest Quality:<a href="#TaoTao Evo 50"> TaoTao Evo 50</a></h3>

If you're looking for a beautiful scooter that has good space for you and a passenger, this is the scooter you want to consider. The Evo 50 has the 12 inch wheels that you and your passenger on your large seat want to go over little bumps. This is the scooter for you if you want a nice looking scooter.

<h3>Honorable Mention:<a href="#TaoTao CY50-A"> TaoTao CY50-A</a></h3>

The CY50-A is shorter scooter which makes it the center of gravity lower to the ground and better for turns. The 10 inch wheels make this a great smaller speedy scooter if that fits more of your style.


## How to Ride a 50cc Scooter (In 5 Minutes!)

<div class="vid-container">

</div>

You heard it right! Riding a 50cc scooter is as easy as riding a bike and just about anyone can do it. Unlike a motorcycle, you have an automatic transmission, so that means you just have to twist the throttle to move forward. I would even say it's easier than riding a bike because you don't have to pedal!

<h2>Tips to Maintain Your Scooter</h2>
 Maintenance is something you need to keep in mind before you buy your scooter. The last thing you want is a poorly maintained scooter, so it's important to keep things in check to keep your scooter running smooth and like new.

 <h3>Read the Manual</h3>
 We all know that nobody wants to read an owner's manual, but knowning your scooter inside and out is a very good start, so it might be a good time to swallow your pride and read the manual. Your scooter manual will help you know all of the parts and controls of your scooter, which is very helpful to knowing your scooter before you go for your first ride. The manual will also let you know the very important maitenance schedule that you should keep track of.

<h3>Keeping a Repair Kit With Your Scooter</h3>
It's always a great idea to be prepared, so of course you should keep a quick repair kit with your scooter at all times. You never know when something might go wrong. Keeping a basic repair kit in your scooter will save you some unwanted hassle in the long run.

Here are some basics that will be necessary for your scooter repair kit:
<ul>
	<li>Strong LED flashlight</li>
	<li>Set of metric wrenches</li>
	<li>Spark plug wrench and spare spark plug</li>
	<li>Pliers and wire cutters</li>
	<li>Rolls of electrical tape and duct tape</li>
	<li>Phillips-head and flat-head screwdrivers</li>
	<li>Zip ties</li>
	<li>3/8" drive metric socket set</li>
	<li>Short length of vacuum/fuel hose</li>
	<li>Short length of wire</li>
</ul>
