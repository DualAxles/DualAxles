<h2>Why Would You Want a Motor Scooter?</h2>

Motor scooters have been around for decades helping people get around. They have been relevant and fantastic forms of 
transportation since the day they were created.

If you enjoy an adventure on the open road or if you just need a good way 
to get to work, a scooter may just be the thing you are looking for.

If you are thinking that scooters are lame or aren't 
cool; throw that thought right out of your head while you learn the advantages of choosing a scooter.

Here's a quick list of the reasons you should invest in a scooter!

<h3 id="great gas mileage">Great Gas Mileage</h3>

One of the many great things about riding a scooter is the incredible gase mileage. Scooters will triumph over cars and motorcycles on MPG.

A four stroke 50cc scooter is more than capable of conquering 100mpg and more. Even the two stroke scooters are easily getting over 80mpg. Many 125cc scooters can also meet around 100mpg. If you happen to be looking for more power, all the way up 300cc you could still be getting well over 60mpg. 

Scooters are kings for saving gas, not to mention money and helping the environment with that gas you are saving. If you care about any of these things, a scooter is a no-brainer decision.

<h3 id="affordable parts & upgrades">Affordable Parts & Upgrades</h3>

Say you just got your scooter, and you want to customize and pimp this thing out; no problem! Parts to upgrade your scooter won't break your bank.

To give you an example, it isn't such a crazy thing to find new tires for just around 50 bucks. Also, say you want to make that 50cc scooter you bought to go faster, you can purchase a 100cc big bore kit for under 100 bucks. The list goes on and there are many options.

<h3 id="comfortable to ride">Comfortable to Ride</h3>

Unlike a motorcycle where you are straddling the bike between your legs, with a scooter you can comfortably sit normally has if you're sitting on a chair with wheels.

A nice place where you can comfortably put your legs and feet, so you won't fatigue as often.

<h3 id="easy to ride">Easy to Ride</h3>

All scooters are automatic, meaning you have no clutch or gears to worry about when you're riding. 

Simply twist the throttle and you're in motion. No wonder why people all ages and all over the world ride scooters.

<h3 id="they don't take up much space">They Don't Take up Much Space</h3>

Have you ever been in a city wondering what parking space you're going to squeeze your car into? It's way easier to find a place to park your scooter because they're so much smaller than a car.

Scooters are perfect forms of transportation for city-dwellers. Depending where you live, some places allow you to lane split or travel on the shoulder leaving all of that traffic behind you.

<h3 id="simple & cheap maintenance">Simple and Cheap Maintenance</h3>

Taking care of your scooter is key for its longevity, and it's easy for any average joe to learn.

Engine oil and tire pressure are going to be the most frequent maintences you'll need to keep track of. Both are inexpensive and the oil you buy will last you a very long time considering scooters don't use much

<h3 id="they're simply a blast to cruise around on">They're Simply a Blast to Cruise Around on</h3>

Cruising around on the open road on two wheels will always be fun. 

The adventures you go on and the memories you make will last you a life time.

50cc scooters may have the smallest engine, but they are still the perfect thing to take you around town. Despite typically not being able to go over 40mph, they are good options and come with advantages that other scooters don't have.

Since 50cc scooters are only 50cc, in many states you do not need a motorcycle license to drive one. In some states you do not even need a license or a moped permit. For states like Maryland, you are supposed to drive on the shoulder(if available). Driving on the shoulder may sound like a pain, but this gives you the option of passing traffic and getting ahead of everyone even though you'll probably be going under 40mph. However we recommend checking with your state and local laws, so that you know how you can legally ride your scooter.

50cc scooters offer you the best mpg out of all of the engine sizes for scooters because they need less gass. Being able to go over 100 miles on just one tank of gas is a huge advantage.

These scooters can also be fun projects if you are a beginner or someone who just likes projects. Aftermarket parts for these fun bikes are heavily available online, so you have the ability to upgrade your scooter and make it perform however you want.
